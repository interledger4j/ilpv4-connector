         * need some other signaling here to indicate such a thing. For example, we might set an attribute in the
         * Link that indicates the identifier of the accountProvider it should be using. This scenario is slightly
         * odd, however, because we would need two AccountProviders, each configured with a different AccountProvider
         * config and identifier, yet both serving requests on the same transport (like a BTP connection). So, in
         * order to pull this off, we would need pretty significant refactoring (or some other indicator in the
         * BTP or HTTP session to indicate the account-type).
