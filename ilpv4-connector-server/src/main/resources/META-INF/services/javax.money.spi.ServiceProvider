# JavaMoney Bootstrap ServiceLoader
# See https://github.com/JavaMoney/javamoney-lib/blob/master/javamoney-cdi/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/javax.money.spi.ServiceProvider
# To use Spring Beans as JavaMoney implementations.

# NOTE: this is currently not enabled because the JavaMoney SPI and the Spring configuration don't seem to work well
# together. For now, we simply use the SPI mechanism to load exchange rate providers.
