/**
 * <p>Tracks balances for accounts held at this connector.</p>
 *
 * <p>For each account, this Connector tracks a clearing balance (as a signed 64-bit integer) that represents the net
 * position with the account owner. A positive clearing balance indicates the Connector operator has an outstanding
 * liability (owes money) to the account holder. A negative clearing balance represents an asset (the account holder
 * owes money to the operator).</p>
 *
 * <p>In the balance-tracker paradigm, a double-entry accounting model can be implied from any given balance(see
 * above), but only on a net basis. In order to track a full accounting of all balance changes, packets must be
 * separately logged and accumulated using some external reporting system such as Google BigQuery.</p>
 *
 * <p>As an implementation note, the design for this interface is taken from the discussions had in the Interledger
 * Forum (link below). In other words, the implementation track a single clearing balance number and, for nodes that
 * accept pre-payment, have a separate number to track prepaid funds. All ILP packets affect the normal net clearing
 * balance position, and outgoing settlements can be based upon this position. When an implementation receives an
 * incoming settlement, it will clear out as much of the peerâ€™s debt as the settlement covers and any extra would be put
 * into the prepaid funds account.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally, it's important to note that balance tracking is not required in Interleger. A primary reason to
 * track a balance with a peer is if you want to limit the `min_balance` (i.e., an upper bound on the amount of credit
 * to extend a peer). If you don't want to limit this amount, atomically updating a single number in a balance tracker
 * will be a bottleneck for what could be a higher-throughput system. See discussion below in interledger-rs#159.</p>
