/**
 * <p>Tracks balances for accounts held at this connector.</p>
 *
 * <p>For each account, this Connector tracks a clearing balance (as a signed 64-bit integer) that represents the net
 * position with the account owner. A positive clearing balance indicates the Connector operator has an outstanding
 * liability (owes money) to the account holder. A negative clearing balance represents an asset (the account holder
 * owes money to the operator).</p>
 *
 * <p>In the balance-tracker paradigm, a double-entry accounting model can be implied from any given balance(see
 * above), but only on a net basis. In order to track a full accounting of all balance changes, packets must be
 * separately logged and accumulated using some external reporting system such as Google BigQuery.</p>
 *
 * <p>As an implementation note, the design for this interface is taken from the discussions had in the Interledger
 * Forum
 * <a href="https://forum.interledger.org/t/what-should-positive-negative-balances-represent/501/26?u=sappenin">here</a>.
 * In other words, the implementation track a single clearing balance number and, for nodes that accept pre-payment,
 * have a separate number to track prepaid funds. All ILP packets affect the normal net clearing balance position, and
 * outgoing settlements can be based upon this position. When an implementation receives an incoming settlement, it will
 * clear out as much of the peerâ€™s debt as the settlement covers and any extra would be put into the prepaid funds
 * account.</p>
